					<p>I am a self taught programmer and software developer.  I was born in Miami FL, and have lived there my entire life.  Currently a sophomore at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC), I am studying computer engineering with goals of entering the software development industry after graduation.  </p>
					<p>I started programming because I always thought it was really cool and interesting and fell in love with it since then.  I strive to better myself everyday through classes as well as personal projects</p>
					<p>I am currently searching for an internship over the summer of 2015 for software development in an environment where I can learn and apply my skills in programming.</p>

							<h4 class="projecttitle">ECE 110 Course Website</h4>
							<p>Description:	A summer long project where I worked as a web programmer for the UIUC ECE department.  The goal was to rewrite an essential course website for first year students.  This project was significant because of the wide variety of features that were intended for the website</p>

							<p>Skills: HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Designed the system that transcribed plain text course notes into webpages by request, this increased efficiency ten fold because previously the note conversion was done by hand</li>
								<li>Created a system for parsing and generating interactive examples on the fly</li>
								<li>Coded everything on the frontend to the backend from scratch</li>
